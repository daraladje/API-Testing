Inspiration:

Plaid for User Data: one-stop-shop for resource sharing or some connected API

Data is siloed away across different consumer platforms. There needs to be a way to integrate consumer data into a single unified infrastructure, where all data can be linked and normalized. The benefit: better CRM and increased personalization & recommendation. It will also allow new entrants to make it into the field without relying on scale for a data-informed product experience. Consumer platforms should be able to communicate with one another (current APIs of LinkedIn, Twitter, Airbnb suck or are extremely limited). 

Plaid unlocked visibility into financial data, but why not unlock visibility into ALL data?

This will be updated as I test new APIs, but I've slowly realized a lot of these are very restrictive.
